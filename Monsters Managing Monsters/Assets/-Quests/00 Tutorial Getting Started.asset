  TaskBrief: Welcome to the job!
  DescriptionDialogue: 'So you''re here for a job! n//n  Let''s skip the formalities.
    I''ll  give you a brief of the job details. n//n There''s been an increase in
    hero activity lately, and that is SUPER bad for everyone''s moral. They attack,
    like, once a week! It''s crazy! n//n Here''s where you come in. n//n Our moral
    is at an ALL. TIME. LOW. Everyone''s so worried about these heroes that they''ve
    toootally forgotten to do their own work. n//n If you work as the odd jobs around
    here and help people who are in need, that will help us sooo much! No strings
    attached! (... I don''t think) n//n How about it? This has your name written all
    over it! Why don''t you take on the job? '
  AcceptedDialogue: You'll do it? Awesome! I've written your name down. Let's get
    to it, rookie! Why don't you grab a PDA from the booth to your left?
  DeclinedDialogue: '... Hmmm? Sorry, did you say something? I''ve already written
    your name down. Let''s get to it, rookie! Why don''t you grab a PDA from the booth
    to your left?'
  FinishDialogue: You did it! See, I knew you had it in you! Wow, a few moments ago
    you were a wimpy, disgusting Imp. Now when I look at you, I see a wimpy, disgusting
    Imp... with a job! n//n You didn't catch that? Good! n//n Our office is known
    for being a liiittle harsh on new recruits, but don't let that get you down, okay?
    n//n It's perfectly normal! Every office is like that! Don't contact our boss
    about it! n//n Well... Looks like you're ready to tackle on the real world. Take
    the elevator to your right to start your new job. I'll see you in the office~
  FailDialogue: Ah shucks. You can do it next time! I believe in you!
  WaitingDialogue: I've already written your name down. Let's start with the initiation!
    Why don't you grab a PDA from the booth to your left?
