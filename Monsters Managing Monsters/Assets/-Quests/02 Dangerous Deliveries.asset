  ST_descriptionDialogue: "Hey, you \u2013 yeah, you. We got some doughnuts in that
    I gotta go dish around, but frankly Pigman Jim is roaming about and he can\u2019t
    hold back when food is about. n//n I\u2019m not in the mood for running today.
    But hey, you look weedy and fast. What do you say? "
  ST_acceptedDialogue: "Thanks. I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re brave or stupid,
    but watch out\u2026 He loves them doughnuts\u2026 "
  ST_declinedDialogue: Not now? I can wait.
  ST_finishDialogue: "And you made it back without a bite taken out of you, yourself.
    Thanks, uh\u2026 Guy. "
  ST_failDialogue: "He caught you didn\u2019t he? Bad luck there. Least he didn\u2019t
    take a bite outta you too. "
